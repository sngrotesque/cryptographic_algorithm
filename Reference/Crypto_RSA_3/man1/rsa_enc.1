rsa_enc \- an RSA encrypter

.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP
rsa_enc [ OPTIONS ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
The rsa_enc utility encrypts data using the RSA public key crypto system.

.br
Two encryption modes are available:
.br
.IP
Full encryption \- the entire contents of the encrypted file is encrypted by
RSA processing (modular exponentiation). Encryption and decryption are fairly
slow. Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) cipher modes
are supported.
.br
.IP
Quick encryption \- encryption will be done by xoring the file's contents with
the values of a sequence generated by a pseudo random number generator (RNG)
initiated by some random seed. Only the seed itself gets encrypted by RSA
processing. As the name suggests, encryption and decryption are are quick.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
.TP
\fB\-h \-\-help\fR
Output help information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-s \-\-scan\fR
Scans the key directory and outputs the available keys.
.TP
\fB\-x[key] \-\-default[=key]\fR
Set the default public Key. \fIkey\fR is the key name output by the \-\-scan
option. If \fIkey\fR is not provided no default public key is set. Otherwise,
\fIkey\fR is set as default public key (if it exists).
.TP
\fB\-p \-\-path\fR
Output the path where where public keys are to be searched. If RSA_KEYPATH is
set then its value is returned, otherwise it is the current working directory.
.TP
\fB\-q \-\-quiet\fR
Provide minimal output.
.TP
\fB\-v \-\-verbose\fR
Provide verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-f <name> \-\-file=<name>\fR
\fIname\fR is the file to encrypt.
.TP
\fB\-l <lev> \-\-level=<lev>\fR
Set the encryption level to \fIlev\fR. Supported encryption levels are:
128(default), 256, 512 and 1024 bits.
.TP
\fB\-r \-\-rsa\fR
Set full RSA encryption mode. By default, quick RSA encryption mode is used.
.TP
\fB\-c \-\-cbc\fR
Set the cipher mode to CBC. By default, ECB cipher mode is used.
.TP
\fB\-k <curr> \-\-key=<curr>\fR
Use the public key \fIcurr\fR for the current encryption. This option overrides
the default public key if it has been set.
.TP
\fB\-o \-\-original\fR
Keep the file after it has been encrypted. Encryption of file \fIname\fR will
produce the cypher text \fIname.enc\fR. If the switch is not set, the file
\fIname\fR will be deleted once it has been encrypted.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.LP
.TP
\fBRSA_KEYPATH\fP
Specifies the directory where where public RSA keys are searched and scanned.
