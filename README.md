这个仓库记录了我开发的加密算法的整体流程，可以看到很多故事。

但是在2023年5月，我已将加密算法从此仓库分离。
所以也就意味着这个仓库的加密算法都是非常旧的版本，为了安全考虑，请不要使用它们。

This warehouse records the overall process of the encryption algorithm I developed, and you can see many stories.

But in May 2023, I separated the encryption algorithm from this warehouse.
So it means that the encryption algorithms in this warehouse are all very old versions. For security reasons, please do not use them.
